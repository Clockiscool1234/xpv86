BFCacheFault_000_Help=Database Page Faults/sec is the rate that database file page requests require the database cache manager to allocate a new page from the database cache.
BFCacheEvict_000_Help=Database Page Evictions/sec is the rate that database file page requests that require the database cache manager to allocate a new page from the database cache force another database page out of the cache.  The eviction count is charged when the page is allocated and not when the previous owner of that page was actually evicted from the cache.  If this rate is too high, the database cache size may be too small.
BFAvailStallsPerSec_000_Help=Database Page Fault Stalls/sec is the rate of page faults that cannot be serviced because there are no pages available for allocation from the database cache.  If this counter is non-zero most of the time, the clean threshold may be too low.
BFCacheSize_000_Help=Database Cache Size is the amount of system memory used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.  If the database cache size seems to be too small for optimal performance and there is very little available memory on the system (see Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance.  If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.  Increasing this limit may increase performance.
BFPctStartFlushThreshold_000_Help=Database Cache % Available Min is the minimum percentage of the database cache that is kept to be allocated to cache database pages that are newly created or read in from the database file(s).

This percentage should be set as low as possible without causing the actual percentage to drop to zero, causing cache fault stalls.  [Dev Only]

Module Name:

    rsvpcnts.h

Abstract:

    Offset definition file for extensible counter objects and counters

    These "relative" offsets must start at 0 and be multiples of 2 (i.e.
    even numbers). In the Open Procedure, they will be added to the 
    "First Counter" and "First Help" values for the device they belong to, 
    in order to determine the absolute location of the counter and 
    object names and corresponding Explain text in the registry.

    This file is used by the extensible counter DLL code as well as the 
    counter name and Explain text definition file (.INI) file that is used
    by LODCTR to load the names into the registry.
